❚ Cluster 0 – Hartford “Solo”
• Historically low prices but the biggest sale-to-assessment gap (~63 %).
• Urban “bargains” disappeared fastest; this shows the need for quicker reassessment.
❚ Cluster 1 – Mainstream Suburbia
• Broad mix of family-oriented suburbs and midsize towns (Avon, Berlin, Wethersfield).
• Comfortable prices and balanced taxes; serves as the state’s “typical” market barometer.
❚ Cluster 2 – Gold Coast & Weekend Estates
• Affluent Fairfield & Litchfield enclaves (Greenwich, Darien, Westport, Roxbury).
• Already pricey before COVID; gains large in dollars though moderate in percent.
• Driven by NYC commuter wealth and second-home demand.

❚ Cluster 3 – Value-Hunter Winners
• Smaller cities and rural towns east of I-91 (Bridgeport, Ansonia, etc.).
• Started most affordable; buyers priced out of Cluster 2 migrated here, lifting prices fastest.
• Rapid appreciation boosts tax base but raises new affordability concerns.
6 Conclusion
This study set out to turn two decades of Connecticut deed records (2001 – 2022) into a clear picture of how, where, and why home prices change. By linking annual time-series charts with town-level clustering, several consistent patterns emerged.
•	Market cycles are stark. Sales peaked in 2005, collapsed after the 2008 recession, then bounced back in 2020-2021 when ultra-low mortgage rates and work-from-home demand met a tight supply. Median prices now stand roughly 30 % higher than before the pandemic, even though 2022 sales volumes have already cooled.
•	Location still rules price. Border towns near New York, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island and shoreline communities along Long Island Sound both command clear premiums. The Gold-Coast towns (Greenwich, Darien, Westport, etc.) remain the state’s costliest markets, while mid-state rural and mill towns anchor the lower end.
•	Connecticut’s housing market sorts into four clear segments. Hartford stands on its own: still relatively cheap, yet sales run about 60 percent above assessment, exposing a major reassessment lag. Mainstream Suburbia (89 towns) forms the broad middle, tracking statewide trends without luxury premiums. Gold-Coast & Weekend-Estate towns (12 affluent Fairfield/Litchfield communities) remain the priciest, posting the largest dollar gains as New-York commuters and second-home demand stays strong. Value-Hunter towns (67 inland or small-city areas) started cheapest but logged the fastest percentage jumps—30 to 70 percent—showing how price pressure has migrated away from the coast. Together, the clusters reveal a nuanced geography where each segment responds differently to the same economic shocks.

•	Policy signals. Hartford’s reassessment lag shows why faster revaluations matter for tax fairness. Inland “value” towns now face new affordability pressure, hinting at future demand for starter-home or zoning reforms.



Limitations and next steps

Results rely on publicly reported assessments that can lag actual market conditions; repeating the analysis after the next statewide revaluation will test the stability of the clusters. Adding borrower income, renovation permits, or school-quality scores could further sharpen the town profiles.

In short, Connecticut’s housing market is no longer a single story of coastal affluence versus inland thrift. It is four distinct segments moving through the same economic shocks at different speeds—an insight that homeowners, planners, and investors can all use to make better decisions.
